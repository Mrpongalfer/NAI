Directive: Project Completion & Final Polish (Quantum Orchestrator - v4.0.FINAL.ASSISTANT)
Objective: Utilizing Replit's editing capabilities, finalize the Quantum Orchestrator project to ensure complete implementation of all previously defined features, including Zero-Touch Integration, Quantum-Inspired Optimization, Intent-Driven Workflow Synthesis, and seamless Core Team archetype integration. The end state must be a fully functional, polished, and deployable artifact.
Target Modifications:
 * Code Finalization: Review all generated modules and functions within core/, handlers/, services/, automation/, and utils/. Ensure all placeholder logic is replaced with complete and robust implementations. Pay particular attention to error handling, logging, and adherence to True Prime Code standards.
 * AI Agent Refinement (ai_agents/):
   * PlanningAgent: Enhance the logic for intent analysis, workflow design, and tool/service selection. Ensure it can generate complex, multi-step workflows with appropriate parameters and data flow.
   * CodeAgent (If partially implemented): Ensure it can generate functional code snippets based on the PlanningAgent's instructions.
   * TestAgent (If partially implemented): Implement basic automated testing of generated code and executed workflows.
   * OptimizationAgent: Fully implement the reinforcement learning framework for code refinement and integrate it with execution feedback.
 * Service Completion (services/):
   * LLMService: Ensure robust interaction with the chosen free LLM API, including error handling, rate limiting, and secure API key management.
   * IntegrationService: Finalize the active and passive service discovery mechanisms and ensure the invoke_service function is fully operational.
   * ApiService: Ensure all intended API endpoints are implemented, including /execute and /discover_services, with proper request/response handling.
   * QualityService: Ensure proper execution and parsing of flake8, black, and pytest.
 * Non-Developer Interface (gui/): Ensure the basic web-based GUI is functional, allowing users to interact with the template library and trigger basic workflows.
 * Testing (tests/): Expand the unit test suite to provide comprehensive coverage of all core functionalities, handlers, and services, including the newly integrated advanced features.
 * Documentation (docs/): Review and complete the markdown documentation to accurately reflect the final state of the project, including usage instructions for all features and API endpoints.
 * Packaging (setup.py): Verify that the setup.py file is correctly configured to package the entire project and its dependencies for deployment.
Directive: Replit's editing capabilities are now directed to perform a comprehensive sweep of the Quantum Orchestrator project, ensuring all components are fully implemented, logically sound, and adhere to the highest standards of quality and functionality. The final output must be a complete and deployable automation platform that aligns precisely with the Architect's intended design.
Execute.
