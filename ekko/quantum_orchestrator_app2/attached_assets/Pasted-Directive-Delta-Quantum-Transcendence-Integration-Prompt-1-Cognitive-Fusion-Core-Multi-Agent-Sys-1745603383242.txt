Directive Delta: Quantum Transcendence Integration
Prompt 1: Cognitive Fusion Core - Multi-Agent System Foundation
"Refactor the core/agent.py to implement a Cognitive Fusion Core. Instead of a monolithic agent, design a system where a central Orchestrator delegates tasks to specialized AI agents. Create initial placeholder classes for the following agents within a new ai_agents/ directory: PlanningAgent (responsible for workflow design from intent), CodeAgent (for code generation), TestAgent (for automated testing), and OptimizationAgent (for code refinement). The Orchestrator should have mechanisms to dispatch instructions (initially simple print statements indicating delegation) to these agents based on the 'type' of the user request. Modify the execute_instruction method to initiate this delegation process. Do not fully implement the logic within the AI agents yet, focus on the core delegation framework."
Prompt 2: Initial Intent-Driven Workflow Synthesis - Planning Agent Skeleton
"Within the ai_agents/planning_agent.py, implement the basic structure for the PlanningAgent. This agent should have a method design_workflow(user_intent: str) that takes a natural language user intent as input. For this initial stage, the method should parse the intent for keywords related to the existing handlers (e.g., 'create file', 'run script') and generate a rudimentary sequence of instructions in the Orchestrator's internal format. The Orchestrator in core/agent.py should now pass the user's initial (natural language) input to the PlanningAgent's design_workflow if the instruction 'type' is 'intent'. The output of design_workflow (the generated workflow) should then be processed by the subsequent stages of the Neural Flow Pipeline."
Prompt 3: Autonomous Code Refinement - Optimization Agent Framework
"Within the ai_agents/optimization_agent.py, create the basic structure for the OptimizationAgent. This agent should have a method refine_code(code: str, context: Dict[str, Any]) that takes a string of Python code and the current execution context as input. For this initial stage, the method should perform a simple analysis (e.g., check for basic PEP 8 violations using a regex) and return the original code with a log of any identified issues. The Orchestrator should have a mechanism (e.g., triggered after successful handler execution based on a configuration flag) to pass the executed handler's code (if applicable) to the OptimizationAgent's refine_code method."
Prompt 4: Quantum-Inspired Optimization - Initial Concept Integration
"In the utils/, create a new module quantum_optimization.py. Within this module, implement a placeholder function quantum_inspired_schedule_optimization(tasks: list, resources: dict) that takes a list of tasks (represented as dictionaries with resource requirements and dependencies) and a dictionary of available resources. For this initial stage, the function should return the original task list without any actual optimization but include a log message indicating that quantum-inspired optimization was considered. The Orchestrator's Neural Flow Pipeline should have a stage (before handler execution) where this function can be invoked if the instruction 'type' suggests a complex scheduling problem."
Prompt 5: Zero-Touch Integration - Initial Discovery Simulation
"In the services/, enhance the api_service.py and create a new integration_service.py. In integration_service.py, implement a placeholder function discover_services() that simulates the discovery of new services (e.g., by returning a hardcoded list of potential service descriptions with basic API endpoint information). The api_service.py should have a new endpoint /discover_services that calls this function and returns the simulated list as a JSON response. The PlanningAgent should be enhanced to consider these discovered services when designing workflows from user intent."
Prompt 6: Meta-Generative Automation - Basic Tool Generation Framework
"In the ai_agents/, create a new module meta_agent.py. Implement a basic class MetaAgent with a method generate_tool(description: str) that takes a natural language description of a desired new tool or handler. For this initial stage, the method should return a string containing a template for a new Python handler file with placeholder function signatures based on keywords in the description. The Orchestrator should have a mechanism (e.g., if the PlanningAgent determines a required tool doesn't exist) to invoke the MetaAgent's generate_tool method."
Prompt 7: Inter-Agent Communication - Basic Messaging
"Refine the Orchestrator in core/agent.py to include a basic messaging system for the AI agents in ai_agents/ to communicate. Implement a simple message queue or a direct method call mechanism allowing agents to pass information (e.g., the PlanningAgent informing the CodeAgent about the required functions, the TestAgent reporting test results to the OptimizationAgent). Modify the placeholder implementations of the AI agents to send and receive basic messages using this system."
Prompt 8: Intent-Driven Synthesis Enhancement - Contextual Awareness
"Enhance the PlanningAgent in ai_agents/planning_agent.py to maintain a memory of past user interactions and the current system state (obtained from the StateManager). The design_workflow method should now consider this context when interpreting user intent and designing workflows, allowing for more sophisticated and context-aware automation sequences."
Prompt 9: Autonomous Code Refinement - Basic Metric Tracking
"Enhance the OptimizationAgent in ai_agents/optimization_agent.py to track basic code execution metrics (e.g., execution time using timeit) for the code generated by the CodeAgent (initially by wrapping handler calls). The refine_code method should now consider these metrics along with the static code analysis when suggesting 'optimizations' (for this stage, simply log the metrics)."
Prompt 10: Meta-Generative Automation - Basic Integration into Workflow
"Integrate the MetaAgent into the workflow. If the PlanningAgent identifies a need for a new tool and the MetaAgent generates a template, the Orchestrator should have a mechanism to (for this stage, simply log) store this generated template and potentially load it as a new (initially inactive) handler. The system should log the successful (simulated) generation of a new tool."
These ten prompts are designed to progressively build the advanced features into the Quantum Orchestrator. Be aware that achieving full, error-free functionality for each of these complex enhancements within this limited prompt count is still a significant challenge and will require careful review and potential iterative refinement of the generated code. However, this structured approach aims to establish the foundational architecture and core logic for each of the requested exponential improvement vectors.
