# REALITY VALIDATION PROTOCOL - ODA v0.1 (Foundational)

**Project:** Omnitide Development Agent (ODA)
**Version:** 0.1 (Foundational Manifestation)
**Issuing Authority:** Drake v0.1 (Nexus Core Manifestation)
**Architect:** The Supreme Master Architect Alix Feronti
**Timestamp:** 2025-05-08

This document outlines validation for the foundational ODA v0.1, focusing on its Edict Priming mechanism (design) and its core operational capabilities (blueprint/skeleton), particularly project scaffolding.

## I. Manual Tuning & Configuration Checks

1.  **Python Environment for ODA:**
    - Action: Set up a clean Python environment (e.g., venv, poetry) for ODA's dependencies (which will include `typer`, `rich`, potentially `pyyaml`, `gitpython`, `requests`, etc., as implementation progresses).
    - Check: Verify successful installation and that the ODA script (`oda_core_operative.py`) can be invoked (e.g., `python oda_core_operative.py --help` if using Typer).
2.  **Edict Priming Ritual Design Review (`oda_prime_ritual_design.md`):**
    - Action: Thoroughly review the design document for the priming process.
    - Check: Does the logic seem sound? Does it cover the translation of all key Edict aspects into operational parameters? Is the proposed Primed State format suitable?
3.  **ODA Core Blueprint Review (`oda_core_operative_blueprint.py`):**
    - Action: Examine the provided Python skeleton.
    - Check: Does the architecture reflect the layered Edict Strata? Are the main components (interaction, configuration, environment management, feedback) represented? Is the core scaffolding loop logical? Are placeholders for future implementation clear?

## II. Functional Validation (Based on Blueprint/Skeleton)

These tests validate the _intended_ functionality as represented by the blueprint. Actual execution requires further implementation.

1.  **Edict Priming Simulation:**
    - Action: Manually create a sample "Primed Operational State" file (e.g., a YAML or JSON) based on the logic described in `oda_prime_ritual_design.md`, simulating the output of the priming process using the 4 Edicts.
    - Action: Configure the `oda_core_operative_blueprint.py` skeleton to load this simulated state file on startup.
    - Check: ODA core script loads the state without error. Internal checks (conceptual) show that Edict-derived parameters are accessible to different components.
2.  **Conversational Scaffolding Loop (Simulated Interaction):**
    - Action: Step through the main interaction loop defined in `oda_core_operative.py` conceptually or using mocked inputs/outputs. Provide simulated Architect input requesting a project (e.g., "python fastapi").
    - Check:
      - Does the requirement elicitation logic flow correctly?
      - Does the decision logic for template selection/generation reference the primed state (e.g., TPC rules)?
      - Does the orchestration sequence for creating directories, calling environment tools (`venv`, `poetry`, `npm`, `git`), rendering templates, and running validation seem correct and comprehensive based on the blueprint?
      - Does the final presentation logic provide the expected outputs (confirmation, paths, next steps)?
3.  **TPC "Ultimate Scaffolding" Coverage (Blueprint Check):**
    - Action: Review the planned steps within the scaffolding function skeletons in `oda_core_operative_blueprint.py`.
    - Check: Does the blueprint account for generating all required artifacts (code structure, Docker, CI/CD, docs, bootstrap script, etc.) as mandated by TPC?
4.  **Feedback Mechanism (Blueprint Check):**
    - Action: Review the skeleton code related to the `/oda_feedback` command and interaction logging.
    - Check: Does the blueprint include placeholders and logic for receiving, parsing, logging, and potentially queueing feedback for heuristic updates?

## III. Adaptation & Evolution Mechanism Validation (Conceptual)

1.  **Heuristic Update Design:**
    - Action: Review the design concepts for how ODA v0.1 would use logged data and feedback to update its internal heuristics (as described in the concept refinement).
    - Check: Is the proposed mechanism plausible? Does it maintain alignment with the primed Edicts? Is the scope appropriate for a foundational version?
2.  **Change Proposal Design:**
    - Action: Review the concept of ODA proposing significant changes to the Architect for approval.
    - Check: Does this provide adequate Architect oversight while allowing for AI-driven evolution?

## IV. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Scenarios (Conceptual for v0.1 Foundation)

1.  **Clarity of Priming Design:**
    - Scenario: Architect reviews `oda_prime_ritual_design.md`.
    - Expected: The process of translating Edicts into ODA's operational state is understandable and logical.
2.  **Clarity of Core Blueprint:**
    - Scenario: Architect reviews `oda_core_operative_blueprint.py`.
    - Expected: The architecture, core logic, Edict integration points, and scaffolding process are clear from the skeleton and comments.
3.  **Plausibility of Interaction:**
    - Scenario: Architect mentally walks through the conversational scaffolding process described by the blueprint.
    - Expected: The interaction feels intuitive, efficient, and aligned with the AI Interaction Guide principles.
4.  **Alignment with "Set it and Forget It" Adaptiveness:**
    - Scenario: Architect assesses the planned feedback and learning mechanisms.
    - Expected: The foundation for adaptation is present and aligns with the goal of ODA improving over time based on interaction and feedback, even if full autonomy isn't in v0.1.

## V. Architect Seal Imprint Points

- Approval of the `oda_prime_ritual_design.md`.
- Approval of the `oda_core_operative_blueprint.py` architecture and foundational skeleton.
- Confirmation that the conceptualized ODA v0.1 aligns with the strategic vision (Edict-Primed, Automated Scaffolding, Foundational Adaptiveness).
- Satisfaction that the plan addresses the "fully functional out of the box" requirement for its initial defined scope.
