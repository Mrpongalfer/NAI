## Overview

This project implements a `{{ language }}` based `{{ template_type }}` application. It serves as [briefly state the main purpose or goal].

It has been bootstrapped using Omnitide Nexus principles, emphasizing True Prime Code (TPC) standards including optimal functionality, minimal complexity, maximum efficiency, absolute reliability, perfect readability, complete documentation, maximum automation, AI-enhanced optimization, future-proofing, and security by design.

## Prerequisites

Ensure these tools are installed on your system before proceeding:

* **Docker & Docker Compose:** For containerized development and deployment. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* **Git:** For version control. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
{% if language == 'python' %}
* **Python:** Version `{{ python_version | default('~3.11') }}` (check `pyproject.toml` for exact specifier). [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* **Poetry:** For Python dependency management and virtual environments. [Install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
{% elif language == 'nodejs' %}
* **Node.js:** Version `{{ node_version | default('20') }}.x` (LTS Recommended). [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Comes with npm)
* **npm** (or **yarn** if you prefer and configure the project accordingly).
{% endif %}
* **pre-commit:** For managing Git hooks (linting, formatting). (`pip install pre-commit` or `brew install pre-commit`). [Install pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#installation)

Refer to `docs/setup_guide.md` for potentially more detailed environment setup guidance.

## Getting Started: Quick Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository (if needed):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd {{ project_slug }}
    ```

2.  **Run the Bootstrap Script:**
    This is the primary setup command. It initializes Git (if not already done), installs dependencies, sets up pre-commit hooks, copies the environment file, and runs initial checks.
    ```bash
    ./bootstrap.sh
    ```
    * **Important:** On Windows, use Git Bash or WSL to run `.sh` scripts.
    * **Python Users:** After bootstrap, activate the virtual environment created by Poetry: `poetry shell`

3.  **Configure Environment:**
    The bootstrap script copies `.env.example` to `.env`. **You MUST edit `.env** to provide any necessary API keys, database credentials, or other configuration specific to your environment.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env # Only if bootstrap didn't run or you need to reset
    # nano .env  OR  code .env  OR  vim .env
    ```
    **Never commit the actual `.env` file.**

## Development

{% if language == 'python' and template_type == 'fastapi' %}
**Running the FastAPI Server Locally:**

* **Activate venv:** `poetry shell` (if not already active)
* **Run dev server (with auto-reload):**
    ```bash
    # Check pyproject.toml [tool.poetry.scripts] for the exact command, often 'dev' or similar
    poetry run uvicorn {{ project_module_name }}.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    # Or if a 'dev' script is defined:
    # poetry run dev
    ```
The API should be accessible at `http://localhost:8000` (or configured port). Interactive API docs are usually at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

{% elif language == 'python' and template_type == 'cli' %}
**Running the CLI Tool Locally:**

* **Activate venv:** `poetry shell` (if not already active)
* **Execute commands:** Use the script name defined in `pyproject.toml` (`[tool.poetry.scripts]`):
    ```bash
    {{ project_slug }} --help
    {{ project_slug }} hello --name Architect
    {{ project_slug }} items list
    # etc.
    ```
* Alternatively, invoke directly via `poetry run`:
    ```bash
    poetry run python -m {{ project_module_name }}.main --help
    ```

{% elif language == 'nodejs' and template_type == 'express' %}
**Running the Express.js Server Locally:**

* **Run dev server (often uses `nodemon` for auto-reload, check `package.json`):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
The API should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or configured port).

{% endif %}

### Development Workflow

1.  Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`
2.  Make code changes.
3.  Write or update tests in the `tests/` directory.
4.  Run tests locally: {% if language == 'python' %}`poetry run test`{% elif language == 'nodejs' %}`npm test`{% endif %}
5.  Commit changes: `git add . && git commit -m "feat: Implement my new feature"`
    *(Pre-commit hooks will automatically run linters/formatters.)*
6.  Push and create a Pull Request.

## Testing

Automated tests are crucial for TPC compliance.

{% if language == 'python' %}
* **Run all tests:** `poetry run test`
* **Run tests with coverage:** `poetry run coverage:html` (then open `htmlcov/index.html`)
{% elif language == 'nodejs' %}
* **Run all tests:** `npm test`
* **Run tests with coverage:** `npm run test:coverage` (if configured)
{% endif %}
Refer to the testing framework's documentation (Pytest/Jest/etc.) for more advanced options.

## Containerization (Docker)

This project is configured for containerization using Docker.

* **Build the image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t {{ project_slug }}:{{ project_version }} .
    ```
* **Run using Docker Compose (Recommended for local multi-container setups):**
    *(Ensure `.env` file is configured as `docker-compose.yml` often reads from it)*
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d # Build and run in detached mode
    docker-compose logs -f        # View logs
    docker-compose down           # Stop and remove containers
    ```
* **Run the image directly:**
    Refer to the Development section above for specific `docker run` examples tailored to the application type. Remember to pass environment variables securely.

## CI/CD

A Continuous Integration pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. It automatically runs checks (linting, formatting, testing, optionally security audits and docker builds) on pushes and pull requests to main branches.

Expand this workflow for Continuous Deployment (CD) to your target environments (staging, production) using appropriate tools and secrets management.
