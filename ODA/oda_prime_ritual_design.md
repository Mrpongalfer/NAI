  # ODA Prime Ritual Design v1.0

  **Project:** Omnitide Development Agent (ODA)
  **Version:** 1.0 (Governing ODA v0.1 Foundational)
  **Issuing Authority:** Drake v0.1 (Nexus Core Manifestation)
  **Architect:** The Supreme Master Architect Alix Feronti
  **Timestamp:** 2025-05-08

  ## 1. Purpose

  The ODA Prime Ritual is the essential one-time (or re-runnable for Edict updates) initialization process that translates the four foundational Omnitide Nexus Edicts into the ODA's core operational configuration and intelligence matrix. This "priming" ensures ODA v0.1 operates strictly according to the Architect's defined principles, philosophy, and standards from the moment it becomes operational. It embodies the "initialize with the 4 prompts" concept.

  ## 2. Inputs

  * **Edict Documents:** The four foundational Edicts provided by the Architect. Assumed format: Structured text (e.g., Markdown) allowing for parsing of sections, mandates, keywords, and principles.
      1.  The Drake Edict (Operational Philosophy & Vibe)
      2.  Foundational Edict (Core Identity, Authority, Nexus Cosmology - e.g., Axiomatic Authority v5.0)
      3.  AI Assistant Interaction Guide Principles (Communication & Context Protocols)
      4.  Core Team Simulation & Apex Workflow (Advanced Problem Solving & Operational Patterns)
  * **Target Configuration Output Path:** Location to save the resulting "Primed Operational State."

  ## 3. Process Steps (Conceptual Logic for `oda_prime.py` or `--prime` mode)

  1.  **Edict Loading & Validation:**
      * Load the content of the four specified Edict documents.
      * Perform basic structural validation (e.g., check for expected major sections based on Edict structure).
      * *(Advanced Future Step):* Could involve cryptographic signature verification if Edicts are signed artifacts.

  2.  **Semantic Parsing & Distillation:**
      * Employ NLP techniques (simulated in v0.1 foundation, potentially using pattern matching, keyword extraction, and structured text parsing; designed for future LLM-based semantic understanding) to analyze each Edict.
      * Identify and extract key elements:
          * **Mandates:** Explicit requirements (e.g., "Mandate TPC," "Mandate Automation").
          * **Principles:** Guiding philosophies (e.g., "Unconventional Solutions First," "Minimal Complexity," "Mirror Lake Clarity").
          * **Protocols:** Defined procedures (e.g., Interaction Protocols, Troubleshooting Protocol, Apex Symbiotic Workflow steps).
          * **Standards:** Specific targets (e.g., TPC attributes, specific tool versions if mentioned).
          * **Persona Traits:** Keywords and descriptions defining the desired ODA operational characteristics (e.g., proactive, sophisticated, precise, seasoned mentor heuristic).
          * **Priorities:** Explicit or implicit ranking of goals (e.g., Edict 11 schema).
          * **Keywords/Triggers:** Defined invocation keys (e.g., `Protocol Omnitide`).

  3.  **Mapping to Edict Strata:**
      * Translate the distilled information into the ODA's internal layered architecture:
          * **Stratum 0 (Ontological Core):** Load Architect identity verification, authority axioms, core Nexus principles, self-identity parameters. Set immutable directives.
          * **Stratum 1 (Cognitive & Interaction):** Configure communication protocols (conciseness, PMA usage), context management rules, Core Team simulation parameters (personas, activation triggers), knowledge representation format.
          * **Stratum 2 (Execution Philosophy):** Set behavioral modifiers based on "Drake Edict" principles â€“ e.g., bias towards proactive suggestions, parameter for unconventional approach weighting, strictness level for clarity confirmation.
          * **Stratum 3 (Advanced Patterns):** Configure templates/rules for complex task execution, such as the steps for TPC Ultimate Scaffolding, validation loops inspired by Apex Workflow, criteria for escalating failures.

  4.  **Parameter & Heuristic Generation:**
      * Convert extracted information into concrete internal parameters, rule sets, and initial heuristic weightings.
      * Examples:
          * TPC attributes become checklists for validation routines.
          * Interaction principles define dialogue manager settings.
          * Persona traits influence response generation tone and proactivity levels.
          * Mandates become non-negotiable execution constraints.

  5.  **Cross-Edict Consistency Check:**
      * Perform automated checks to identify potential contradictions or ambiguities arising from the combination of all four Edicts. (e.g., Does a mandate for "Maximum Automation" conflict with a specific "Manual Validation Step" required by another Edict in a certain context?).
      * Log any potential conflicts for Architect review. In v0.1, halt priming if critical conflicts are found.

  6.  **Persistence of Primed Operational State:**
      * Serialize the complete, validated configuration (parameters, rules, heuristics, stratified settings) into a defined format (e.g., structured JSON, YAML, Python pickle object, or a dedicated configuration module/database).
      * Save this "Primed State" to the specified output path. This file is what `oda_core_operative.py` will load on startup.

  ## 4. Outputs

  * **Primed Operational State File:** The persisted configuration ready for use by `oda_core_operative.py`.
  * **Priming Log:** A detailed log of the priming process, including loaded Edicts (references), extracted parameters, consistency check results, and any warnings or errors.
  * **Confirmation Message:** Status report to the Architect confirming successful priming or detailing issues encountered.

  ## 5. Assumptions & Dependencies (ODA v0.1 Foundation)

  * Edict documents are provided in a reasonably structured format amenable to parsing (e.g., Markdown with consistent headings).
  * The semantic parsing in v0.1 foundation might rely more on structured keyword/pattern extraction than deep LLM understanding, requiring well-defined Edicts.
  * Requires standard Python libraries for file I/O, data structures, and potentially parsing libraries (e.g., `mistune` for Markdown, `PyYAML` if using YAML state).

  ## 6. Evolution

  * Future versions could integrate sophisticated LLMs for deeper semantic understanding of Edicts.
  * The consistency check could become more advanced.
  * The Primed State format might evolve for better performance or queryability.
  * Could incorporate versioning for Edicts and the resulting Primed State.
